Instructions
Preheat the oven: Set your oven to 400°F (200°C) and allow it to preheat. This ensures that the muffins bake evenly.

Prepare the muffin pan: Line the muffin pan with paper liners. This prevents the muffins from sticking to the pan and makes cleanup easier.

Mix dry ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, combine 1 1/2 cups of all-purpose flour, 3/4 cup of granulated sugar, 1/2 teaspoon of salt, and 2 teaspoons of baking powder. Use a whisk to mix these ingredients thoroughly.

Combine wet ingredients: In a separate bowl, beat 1 large egg. Add 1/3 cup of vegetable oil and 1/3 cup of milk to the egg, and whisk until well combined.

Combine wet and dry ingredients: Pour the wet ingredients into the bowl with the dry ingredients. Use a spatula to gently fold the mixture until just combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can make the muffins tough.

Add blueberries: Gently fold 1 cup of fresh or frozen blueberries into the batter. Ensure the blueberries are evenly distributed throughout the mixture.

Fill the muffin pan: Use a spoon or an ice cream scoop to fill each muffin liner about 2/3 full with batter. This allows room for the muffins to rise.

Bake the muffins: Place the muffin pan in the preheated oven and bake for 20-25 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin comes out clean.

Cool the muffins: Remove the muffin pan from the oven using oven mitts to protect your hands. Place the pan on a cooling rack and let the muffins cool in the pan for about 5 minutes. Then, transfer the muffins directly to the cooling rack to cool completely.
